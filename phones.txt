2. Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra

The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra is the ultimate Android phone for power users. It delivers a built-in S Pen just like a Galaxy Note, and you get 70% less latency for smoother performance. The 6.8-inch display is simply the best we've tested, offering class-leading brightness and color saturation, making this panel easy to read outdoors in direct sunlight and fantastic for watching shows and movies.

The best phone for the money, the iPhone 13 delivers a fantastic camera experience in a compact design. The main camera gathers more light now and the ultra-wide camera captures more of the scene. And the Cinematic mode for video gives you Hollywood-like depth of focus in your footage, thanks to the powerful new A15 Bionic processor.

4. Google Pixel 6

The Google Pixel 6 is the best smartphone to get if you want the ultimate Android experience, especially now that Google has started using its own Tensor chipset to power the phone. Tensor keeps pace with the Snapdragon 888 inside most of the other top Android phones, but more importantly, it powers the kind of machine learning-driven experiences that make Google's phones unique.

CPU: Google Tensor

Storage / Expandable: 128GB, 256GB / No

5. Google Pixel 5a

The Google Pixel 5a has been the best sub-$500 phone you can buy, but we imagine that's about to change. The Pixel 6a arrives in July, and it features Google's own Tensor processor plus a more eye-catching design. If you can wait until the summer, the Pixel 6a may be the more compelling buy.

CPU: Snapdragon 765G
RAM: 6GB

6. Samsung Galaxy A53

The Galaxy A53 is one of the best phones you can buy for less than $500, at least until Google's Pixel 6a arrives and we can test that phone's cameras. But even then, you'll appreciate the fast refreshing display and expandable storage that the Galaxy A53 has to offer. Many phones in the A53's price range don't offer a fast refresh rate, and a lot of phone makers are sacrificing microSD expansion slots.

Display: 6.5-inch OLED (2400x1080; 120Hz)
CPU: Exynos 1280
RAM: 6GB
Storage / Expandable: 128GB / Yes

It may not have the S Pen support or the other maxed out features found on the Galaxy S22 Ultra, but the Galaxy S22 does have something more important for people who want ones of the best phones but don’t want to break their budget getting one — a low price tag. At $799, the Galaxy S22 matches the price of the iPhone 13 while letting you save the couple hundred bucks that a more expensive S22 model commands.

Samsung continues trying to make foldable phones more appealing to mainstream shoppers, and the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a big step forward in that regard. While the $1,799 price is still a lot to pay for a phone, it’s $200 lower than the Galaxy Z Fold 2’s debut cost. And the phone is more durable than ever with an IPX8 water-resistance rating, Armor Aluminum Frame and Gorilla Glass Victus display.
